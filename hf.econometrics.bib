	abstract = {This paper presents a generalized pre-averaging approach for estimating the integrated volatility, in the presence of noise. This approach also provides consistent estimators of other powers of volatility — in particular, it gives feasible ways to consistently estimate the asymptotic variance of the estimator of the integrated volatility. We show that our approach, which possesses an intuitive transparency, can generate rate optimal estimators (with convergence rate n−1/4).},

Our method generalizes the pre-averaging approach (see [Bernoulli 15 (2009) 634–658, Stochastic Process. Appl. 119 (2009) 2249–2276]) and provides consistent estimates for various characteristics of general semimartingales. Furthermore, we prove the associated multidimensional (stable) central limit theorems. As expected, we find central limit theorems with a convergence rate n−1/4, if n is the number of observations.},

	abstract = {This paper reports some of the recent developments in the econometric analysis of semimartingales estimated using high frequency financial returns. It describes a simple yet powerful methodology to decompose asset returns sampled at high frequency into their base components (continuous, small jumps, large jumps), determine the relative magnitude of the components, and analyze the finer characteristics of these components such as the degree of activity of the jumps. We incorporate to effect of market microstructure noise on the test statistics, apply the methodology to high frequency individual stock returns, transactions and quotes, stock index returns and compare the qualitative features of the estimated process for these different data and discuss the economic implications of the results.},

	abstract = {Asset prices observed in financial markets combine equilibrium prices and market microstructure noise. In this paper, we study how to tell apart large shifts in equilibrium prices from noise using high frequency data. We propose a new nonparametric test which allows us to asymptotically remove the noise from observable price data and to discover jumps in fundamental asset values. We provide its asymptotic distribution to decide when such jumps occur. In finite samples, our test offers reasonable power for distinguishing between noise and jumps. Empirical evidence indicates that it is necessary to incorporate the presence of jumps in equilibrium prices.},

	abstract = {This article contributes to the theory for preaveraging estimators of the daily quadratic variation of asset prices and provides novel empirical evidence. We develop asymptotic theory for preaveraging estimators in the case of autocorrelated microstructure noise and propose an explicit test for serial dependence. Moreover, we extend the theory on preaveraging estimators for processes involving jumps. We discuss several jumprobust measures and derive feasible central limit theorems for the general quadratic variation. Using transaction data of different stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange, we analyze the estimators' sensitivity to the choice of the preaveraging bandwidth. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of preaveraging-based inference on the sampling scheme, the sampling frequency, microstructure noise properties, and the occurrence of jumps. As a result of a thorough empirical study, we provide guidance for optimal implementation of preaveraging estimators and discuss potential pitfalls in practice.},
